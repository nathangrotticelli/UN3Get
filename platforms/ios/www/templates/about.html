    What is U Nightlife?
  </div>
  <div class="item item-text-wrap blackClass">
    U Nightlife is a mobile app created by a team of college students obsessed with events. Our goal is to see how we can improve student interaction with the event information around them.
  </div>
  <div class="item item-divider">
    How are events collected?
  </div>
  <div class="item item-text-wrap blackClass">
    Events are collected from every user's social graph, scattered sources around the university area, and "Adding an Event" directly on the mobile app.
     <!-- and, because only verified students can gain access, there's info you won't (and probably shouldn't) find anywhere else -->
  </div>
   <div class="item item-divider">
    What is "Following" someone? <br> How/why should I do it?
  </div>
  <div class="item item-text-wrap blackClass">
    In your profile dropdown, you have the ability to follow or unfollow your Facebook friends who use U Nightlife. When you follow someone, they get a notification, and you see when they discover and "Watch" interesting events in the future. This aids in making and spreading fun plans with the friends around you.
  </div>
  <div class="item item-divider">
    What is "Watching" an event?<br> How do I do it?
  </div>
  <div class="item item-text-wrap blackClass">
    Whether you are viewing an expanded event, the List view, or Swipe view, there will be an eye icon somewhere on the page. This icon allows you to "Watch" an event, creating a clickable notification in both your profile dropdown and the profile dropdown of friends that follow you.
  </div>
  <div class="item item-divider">
    How do I get new events?
  </div>
  <div class="item item-text-wrap blackClass">
    Logging in and pulling the event feed downwards both update your event list.
  </div>
  <div class="item item-divider">
    Who has access to the app?
  </div>
  <div class="item item-text-wrap blackClass">
    Right now, access to the app is restriced to college students, who are verified upon entry via their social graph (Facebook) or .edu email.
  </div>
  <div class="item item-divider">
    How can I spread my own events?
  </div>
  <div class="item item-text-wrap blackClass">
    Using our straightforward "Add an Event" feature, you can submit an event, meeting or activity for review. The UN team will contact you for further event verification.
  </div>
  <div class="item item-divider">
    Can I add an event to my iCal?
  </div>
  <div class="item item-text-wrap blackClass">
    Yes. On an events expanded view (reached by tapping on an event in the List or Swipe view), tap the calendar icon/event date (usually the second item down on the list), and if calendar access is allowed to U Nightlife, you'll recieve a pop up confirmation, and be reminded of the event an hour prior via your iCalendar.
  </div>
   <div class="item item-divider">
    Where can I give feedback?
  </div>
  <div class="item item-text-wrap blackClass">
    Use the "Email Us" button located on the "Help/Contact Us" section of the app (you can navigate there by tapping the menu in the right hand corner). We definitely want to hear from you, good or bad, so don't hesitate.
